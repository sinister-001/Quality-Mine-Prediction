# Quality-Mine-Prediction

In this project we will be seeing another project that I completed as part of my *DS & ML Internship* at **Uniconverge Technologie**.

It is not always easy to find databases from real world manufacturing plants, specially mining plants. This database comes from one of the most important parts of a mining process: a flotation plant. 
The main goal is to use this data to predict how much impurity is in the ore concentrate. As this impurity is measured every hour, if we can predict how much silica (impurity) is in the ore concentrate, we can help the engineers, giving them early information to take actions (empowering!). Hence, they will be able to take corrective actions in advance (reduce impurity, if it is the case) and also help the environment (reducing the amount of ore that goes to tailings as you reduce silica in the ore concentrate). 

Expected submission 
•	Is it possible to predict % Silica Concentrate every minute? 
•	How many steps (hours) ahead can we predict % Silica in Concentrate? This would help engineers to act in predictive and optimized way, mitigating the % of iron that could have gone to tailings. 
•	Is it possible to predict % Silica in Concentrate without using % Iron Concentrate column (as they are highly correlated)? 

The complete code and the evaluation of the model has been mentioned in the code.

Happy learning !! :)
